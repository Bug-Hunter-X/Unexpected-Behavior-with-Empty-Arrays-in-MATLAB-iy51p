# MATLAB Empty Array Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in MATLAB related to the handling of empty arrays. The bug arises from MATLAB's implicit type conversion, which can lead to unexpected results if not properly addressed.

## Bug Description

The `myFunction` function may return an empty array (`[]`) under certain conditions. If the calling code does not explicitly check for this empty array, subsequent operations could fail or produce unexpected results, leading to difficult-to-debug errors. 

## Bug Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking for the empty array using `isempty()` before performing operations that assume a non-empty array. 

## How to reproduce the bug

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `bug.m` in MATLAB.
3.  Run the script to see the error.

## How to solve the bug

1. Open `bugSolution.m` in MATLAB
2. Run the script and see that the error is solved.
